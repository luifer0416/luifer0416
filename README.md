# Hi, There ðŸ‘‹

## I am Luis Ahumedo [:colombia:]
### Ing Aeronautico :artificial_satellite: :rocket: / Ing de Software in progress...  :hourglass: :computer: 


#### I am an aeronautic engineer with three years of experience, especially in the maintenance and reliability area.

#### Currently, I am studying software engineering. Throughout my aeronautic career, I have been involved in software development, studying on my own and applying some software knowledge to my studies and work as an aeronautic engineer. But now I am in the process of formalizing my knowledge, so I am going to upload my different projects and look for a change in my professional career path. :computer:

#### I welcome any opportunity to work with a company, support projects, and contribute to new ventures. I am open to any help or guidance to advance my career :smile:
